--- In AADL, a software component is one of systems, processes, thread groups,
--- thread, subprogram groups, subprograms, and data. All of them can have
--- subcomponents, connections, and properties.

--- In this version, we do not consider "provides/requires subprogramm access"
--- feature, since it may introduce asynchronous behavior. Therefore,
--- subprogram groups are not considered here.
